# Lingo-The-iitkgp-slang
With the ongoing of the online semester, the slang of kgp has to preserved.

This is just a dictionary code for the lingo words.

The reference has been taken from: https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Lingo_of_IIT_Kharagpur
With any change in the https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Lingo_of_IIT_Kharagpur , the dictionary can be updated by running the scrapping_to_json.py file. Python with the required libraries must be installed in the machine.

Procedure to run it:
Step 1: Download the scrapping_to_json.py
Step 2: Run in any directory
Step 2: Download the main.py in the same directory
Step 3: Run main.py, the dictionary file

Note: GUI support will soon be added
    : Any sort of improvement or changes is always welcomed
