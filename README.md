# Lingo-The-iitkgp-slang
With the ongoing of the online semester, the slang of kgp has to preserved.

This is just a dictionary code for the lingo words.

The reference has been taken from: https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Lingo_of_IIT_Kharagpur
With any change in the https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Lingo_of_IIT_Kharagpur , the dictionary can be updated by running the scrapping_to_json.py file. Python with the required libraries must be installed in the machine.

Procedure to run it:
Step 1: git clone github.com/mySpaceHere123/Lingo-The-iitkgp-slang;
Step 2: cd Lingo-The-iitkgp-slang ;
Step 3: python scrapping_to_json.py ;
Step 4: python main.py ; (for macos and linux, use python3)

Note: GUI support will soon be added and any sort of improvement or help is always welcomed
